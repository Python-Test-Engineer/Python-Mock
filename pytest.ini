; When the --strict-markers command-line flag is passed, any unknown marks applied with the @pytest.mark.name_of_the_mark decorator will trigger an error. You can enforce this validation in your project by adding --strict-markers to addopts:

; e.g if you have not setup marker in this file called setupstrict and you use it with pytest -m setupstrict it will throw an error
